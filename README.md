# üìà Analyzing the Influence of Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) Price Movements on Meme Coin Market Capitalization

## üìå Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between the price movements of **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Solana (SOL)** and the market capitalization of two leading meme coins: **Dogecoin (DOGE)** and **Shiba Inu (SHIB)**.  
The goal is to determine whether fluctuations in BTC and SOL prices significantly affect meme coin market behavior using both **statistical regression analysis** and **machine learning approaches**.

## üéØ Motivation
Meme coins are highly speculative assets that often follow broader market sentiment. By understanding whether major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana influence meme coins, we can uncover valuable insights for investors, traders, and researchers interested in crypto market dynamics.

## üìä Hypotheses

### 1. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Influence
- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** Bitcoin price movements do not significantly affect meme coin market capitalization.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê):** Bitcoin price movements significantly and positively influence meme coin market capitalization.

### 2. Solana (SOL) Price Influence
- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** Solana price movements do not significantly affect meme coin market capitalization.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê):** Solana price movements significantly and positively influence meme coin market capitalization.

### 3. Combined BTC & SOL Influence
- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** BTC and SOL price movements together do not significantly influence meme coin market capitalization.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê):** BTC and SOL price movements together significantly influence meme coin market capitalization.

## üì• Data Collection

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Data Sources
Originally planned sources from Kaggle and CoinMarketCap were not used due to missing or inconsistent historical `.csv` data.  
Instead, all data was collected using the **`yfinance`** library for real-time reliability.

### ‚úÖ Assets Used
- **BTC-USD** ‚Äì Bitcoin price and returns
- **SOL-USD** ‚Äì Solana price and returns
- **DOGE-USD** ‚Äì Dogecoin market cap (derived)
- **SHIB-USD** ‚Äì Shiba Inu market cap (derived)
- **PEPE-USD** ‚Äì **Excluded** due to insufficient historical range (~4 months)

### üïí Time Range
- Aligned daily data from **2020-08-01** to **2025-05-29**
- Final dataset: **1,762 observations** after preprocessing

---

## üßπ Data Processing

- **Missing Values:** Forward-filled missing values to ensure alignment
- **Market Cap Calculation:**  
  \[
  \text{Market Cap} = \text{Close Price} \times \text{Volume Proxy}
  \]
- **Returns Calculation:** Daily percentage changes computed for all assets
- **PEPE Exclusion:** Removed due to limited historical range
